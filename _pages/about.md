## WORK EXPERIENCES 
Passionate manufacturing system engineer with 7+ years of progressive experiences in designing the mfg system architecture and automation robots. Especially, focused on developing and optimizing the automated dispatching scheduler system that predicts the factory inventory position and optimizes mfg schedule based on the enumerous mfg simulation data in the last 5 years. 

### Manufacturing System Engineer at Samsung Austin Semiconductor (2017-)
Developing and improving manufacturing system logics on scheduling modules and simulation engines to forecast factory inventory position, as well as optimizing automatic dispatching system logic by utilization of linear programming.
- Awarded by president for the INNOVATION: Developed FABIN/OUT Automation system to handle all fabin/out manual activities and reduce needed manpower, time and chance of error by JAVA and ezDFS. 50% reduction of manpower (4 to 2 speicalist/shift) and 72% reduction in lot create/start time (60.6 to 16.9 mins/lot).
- Awarded Smart Manufacturing Bronze Certification.
-  Designed and developed input forecasting model from MP/FP in Java leading to 20% reduce tool idle time.

### Production Engineer at A123 Systems (2015-2017)
Developed and refined manufacturing process and the system to monitor the inventory position and trace scraps.
- Improved equipment efficiency up to 87% and reduced scrap cost by 14% per month by reconfiguring the plant layout and production process. 
- Reduced the downtime up to 17% per pack and improved takt time in the pack assembly line.

### Manufacturing R&D Engineer at PSA Inc (2013-2015)
Developed new manufacturing automation and its process to improve performance and quality.
- Developed an automatic vision inspection system to check non-conforming products and mixing parts in PLC and Visual Basic. Contributed to reduce a field claim and a scrap cost up to 77% (approx. $173,000/year)
