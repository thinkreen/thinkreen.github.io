I am so excited to share my experiences and TILs through my porfolio blog.<br>
If you have different opinion or suggestion, please add your comment or send me an email.<br>
Thank you so much.<br>

Passionate system development engineer with 6+ years of progressive experience in designing the manufacturing system architecture, predicting the factory inventory position and optimizing the manufacturing schedule in semiconductor and Li-polymer battery industries. At Samsung Austin Semiconductor, implemented input and lot position forecasting models improving forecast accuracy by 24%.

Here is my key experiences. If you want to see my resume, click [here](resume.pdf)

## 2017-
### Manufacturing System Engineer at Samsung Austin Semiconductor
<p>Developing and improving manufacturing system logics on scheduling modules and simulation engines to forecast factory inventory position, as well as optimizing automatic dispatching system logic by utilization of linear programming.<br>
<br>• Awarded by president for the INNOVATION: Developed FABIN/OUT Automation system to handle all fabin/out manual activities and reduce needed manpower, time and chance of error by JAVA and ezDFS. 50% reduction of manpower (4 to 2 speicalist/shift) and 72% reduction in lot create/start time (60.6 to 16.9 mins/lot).
<br>• Awarded Smart Manufacturing Bronze Certification.
<br>• Designed and developed input forecasting model from MP/FP in Java leading to 20% reduce tool idle time.
</p>



## 2015-2017
