  <h3>Intro</h3>
  <p>Hi, my name is David S. Kim.</p>
  <p>I love learning new technical/soft skills and expanding my knowledge boundaries. But I believe that if I cannot explain or share what I learned to others, I didnâ€™t acquire it perfectly. Therefore, I am going to share daily what I learned through my portfolio blog. And I will post my accomplishments, too.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in my career or projects, even different opinion or suggestion to my posting, please add your comment or send me an email.</p>
  <p>Thank you so much.</p>
