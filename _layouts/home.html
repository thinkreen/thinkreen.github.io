<div class="Intro">
  <p>Hi, my name is David S. Kim.</p>
  <p>I love to learn new technical/soft skills and expand my knowledge boundaries. But I believe that if I cannot explain or share what I learned to others, I didnâ€™t acquire it perfectly. Therefore, I am going to share daily what I learned through my portfolio blog. And I will post my accomplishments, too.<br>
  </p>

If you are interested in my career or projects, even different opinion or suggestion to my posting, please add your comment or send me an email.<br>

Thank you so much.<br>
